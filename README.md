#ABOUT THIS PROJECT
In this project we will make an arduino clock alarm with timer and a temperature sensor.

Button #1 Mode - connected to digtal pin 2

Button #2 Select - connected to digtal pin 4

Button #3 Plus - connected to digtal pin 3

Button #4 Minus - connected to digtal pin 12

Button #5 Timer on/0ff - connected to digtal pin 11

You can wire all of the component to a breadboard or wire to a arduino proto shield if you would like to use the case.

To set time you will need to hold the mode button on screen 1.
